		<p>Wine tasting (often, in wine circles, simply tasting) is the sensory examination and evaluation of wine. While the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its
	    production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become established from the 14th century onwards. Modern, professional wine tasters (such as sommeliers or
	    buyers for retailers) use a constantly evolving formal terminology which is used to describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and general characteristics
	    of a wine. More informal, recreational tasting may use similar terminology, usually involving a much less analytical process for a more general, personal 
	    appreciation.</p>


		<h2 id="Tasting stages">Tasting stages</h2>


		<p>The results of the four recognized stages to wine tasting:</p>

			<ol id="results">
				<li>appearance</li>
				<li> "in glass" <em>the aroma of the wine</em></li>
				<li> "in mouth" <em>sensations</em></li>
				<li> "finish" <em>(aftertaste)</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p><i>- are combined in order to establish the following properties of a wine:</i></p>
			<ol id= "results">
				<li>complexity and character</li>
				<li>potential <em>(suitability for aging or drinking)</em></li>
				<li>possible faults</li>
			</ol>
			<p>A wine's overall quality assessment, based on this examination, follows further careful description and comparison with recognized standards, both with respect
		    to other wines in its price range and according to known factors pertaining to the region or vintage; if it is typical of the region or diverges in style; if
		    it uses certain wine-making techniques, such as barrel fermentation or malolactic fermentation, or any other remarkable or unusual characteristics.
		    </br>
			Whereas wines are regularly tasted in isolation, a wine's quality assessment is more objective when performed alongside several other wines, in what are known
			as tasting "flights". Wines may be deliberately selected for their vintage ("horizontal" tasting) or proceed from a single winery ("vertical" tasting), to 
			better compare vineyard and vintages, respectively. Alternatively, in order to promote an unbiased analysis, bottles and even glasses may be disguised in a 
			"blind" tasting, to rule out any prejudicial awareness of either vintage or winery.</p>

		<h2 id="Blind tasting">Blind tasting</h2>

		<p>To ensure impartial judgment of a wine, it should be served blind — that is, without the taster(s) having seen the label or bottle shape. Blind tasting may
		also involve serving the wine from a black wine glass to mask the color of the wine. A taster's judgment can be prejudiced by knowing details of a wine, such 
		as geographic origin, price, reputation, color, or other considerations.</p>

		<p>Scientific research has long demonstrated the power of suggestion in perception as well as the strong effects of expectancies. For example, people expect
		more expensive wine to have more desirable characteristics than less expensive wine. When given wine that they are falsely told is expensive they virtually
		always report it as tasting better than the very same wine when they are told that it is inexpensive. French researcher Frédéric Brochet "submitted a mid-range
		 Bordeaux in two different bottles, one labeled as a cheap table wine, the other bearing a grand cru etiquette." Tasters described the supposed grand cru as 
		 "woody, complex, and round" and the supposed cheap wine as "short, light, and faulty."</p>

		<p>Similarly, people have expectations about wines because of their geographic origin, producer, vintage, color, and many other factors. For example, when
		Brochet served a white wine he received all the usual descriptions: "fresh, dry, honeyed, lively." Later he served the same wine dyed red and received the
		usual red terms: "intense, spicy, supple, deep."</p>

		<p>One of the most famous instances of blind testing is known as the Judgment of Paris, a wine competition held in 1976 where French judges blind-tested
		wines from France and California. Against all expectations, California wines bested French wines according to the judges, a result which would have been
		unlikely in a non-blind contest. This event was depicted in the 2008 movie Bottle Shock.</p>

		<p>Another well-publicized double-blind taste test was conducted in 2011 by Prof. Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire. In a wine tasting 
		experiment using 400 participants, Wiseman found that general members of the public were unable to distinguish expensive wines from inexpensive ones.
		 "People just could not tell the difference", said Wiseman, "between cheap and expensive wine".</p>

		<h2 id="Vertical and horizontal tasting">Vertical and horizontal tasting</h2>
		 
		 <p>
		 <b>Vertical and horizontal wine tastings</b> are wine tasting events that are arranged to highlight differences between similar wines.</p>
			
			<ol id="tasting">
				<li>In a <b>vertical tasting, </b> different vintages of the same wine type from the same winery are tasted. This emphasizes differences between various vintages.</li>
				
				<li>In a <b>horizontal tasting, </b> the wines are all from the same vintage but are from different wineries. Keeping wine variety or type and wine region the same helps emphasize differences in winery styles.</li>
