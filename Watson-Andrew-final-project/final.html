							<h3> The First Video Game</h3>
						</hgroup>
						<p>Early games used interactive electronic devices with various display formats. The earliest 
						example is from 1947â€”a "Cathode ray tube Amusement Device" was filed for a patent on 25 
						January 1947, by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann, and issued on 14 December 1948, 
						as U.S. Patent 2455992.
						<br>
						Inspired by radar display tech, it consisted of an analog device that allowed a user to control
						a vector-drawn dot on the screen to simulate a missile being fired at targets, which were drawings
						fixed to the screen.
						Other early examples include:
							<ol>
								<li>The Nimrod computer at the 1951 Festival of Britain</li>
    							<li>OXO a tic-tac-toe Computer game by Alexander S. Douglas for the <abbr title="Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator">EDSAC</abbr> in 1952</li>
    							<li>Tennis for Two, an electronic interactive game engineered by William Higinbotham in 1958</li>
    							<li>Spacewar!, written by <abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr> students Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen's on a DEC <abbr title="Programmed Data Processor-1">PDP-1</abbr> computer in 1961.</li>
    						</ol></p>
						<p>Each game used different means of display: NIMROD used a panel of lights to play the game of Nim, OXO used 
						a graphical display to play tic-tac-toe Tennis for Two used an oscilloscope to display a side view of a 
						tennis court, and Spacewar! used the DEC PDP-1's vector display to have two spaceships battle each other.
						Nolan Bushnell at the Game Developers Conference in 2011<br>
						In 1971, Computer Space, created by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, was the first commercially sold, coin-operated
						video game. It used a black-and-white television for its display, and the computer system was made of 74 series TTL chips.
						The game was featured in the 1973 science fiction film Soylent Green. Computer Space was followed in 1972 by the Magnavox
						Odyssey, the first home console. Modeled after a late 1960s prototype console developed by Ralph H. Baer called the "Brown Box",
						 it also used a standard television. These were followed by two versions of Atari's Pong; an arcade version in 1972 and a home
						  version in 1975 that dramatically increased video game popularity. The commercial success of Pong led numerous other companies
						   to develop Pong clones and their own systems, spawning the video game industry.</p>

							<h2> Video Game</h2>
							<h3 id="Past Till Now">Past Till Now</h3>

						<p>A video game is an electronic game that involves human interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback
						 on a video device. The word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device, but it now implies any 
						 type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. The electronic systems used to play video games are 
						 known as platforms; examples of these are personal computers and video game consoles. These platforms range from large mainframe
						computers to small handheld devices. Specialized video games such as arcade games, while previously common, have gradually declined 
						in use. Video games have gone on to become an art form and industry.<br>
						The input device primarily used to manipulate video games is called a game controller, and varies across platforms. For example, a 
						controller might consist of only a button and a joystick, while another may feature a dozen buttons and one or more joysticks. Early
						 personal computer games often needed a keyboard for gameplay, or more commonly, required the user to buy a separate joystick with at
						least one button. Many modern computer games allow or require the player to use a keyboard and a mouse simultaneously. A few of 
						the most common game controllers are gamepads, mouses, keyboards, and joysticks. In recent years, additional methods of input have 
						emerged such as camera-based player observation for video game consoles and touch-sensitive screens on mobile devices.</p>

									<h3>Platforms</h3>
								<p>The term "platform" refers to the specific combination of electronic components or computer hardware which, in conjunction
								with software, allows a video game to operate. The term "system" is also commonly used.<br>
								In common use a "PC game" refers to a form of media that involves a player interacting with an IBM PC compatible 
								personal computer connected to a video monitor. A "console game" is played on a specialized electronic device that connects
								to a common television set or composite video monitor. A "handheld" gaming device is a self-contained electronic device 
								that is portable and can be held in a user's hands. "Arcade game" generally refers to a game played on an even more 
								specialized type of electronic device that is typically designed to play only one game and is encased in a special cabinet.
								These distinctions are not always clear and there may be games that bridge one or more platforms. In addition to personal 
								computers, there are multiple other devices which have the ability to play games but are not dedicated video game machines, 
								such as mobile phones, PDAs and graphing calculators.</p>
								<p>With the advent of social networking and other online applications hubs, the term "platform" started being used to refer
								 to the online service within which the game is played, regardless of the actual hardware on which it is executed. A game's
								 platform could simply be "Facebook", whether it is played on a Windows PC, Mac, Smart TV, or smartphone.</p>

								<h3>Cheating</h3>
								<p><em>Cheating</em> in computer games may involve cheat codes and hidden spots implemented by the game developers, modification of 
								game code by third parties, or players exploiting a software glitch.Modifications are facilitated by either cheat cartridge
								hardware or a software trainer. Cheats usually make the game easier by providing an unlimited amount of some resource; for 
								example weapons, health, or ammunition; or perhaps the ability to walk through walls. Other cheats might give access to 
								otherwise unplayable levels or provide unusual or amusing features, like altered game colors or other graphical appearances.
								</p>
							</section>
							<section id="Modification">
							<h3>Modification</h3>
								<p>Many games produced for the PC are designed such that technically oriented consumers can <em>modify</em> the game. These mods 
								can add an extra dimension of replayability and interest. 
								</p>
							</section>
							<section id="Glitches">
							<h3>Glitches</h3>
								<p><em>Software errors</em> not detected by software testers during development can find their way into released versions of 
								computer and video games. This may happen because the glitch only occurs under unusual circumstances in the game, 
								was deemed too minor to correct, or because the game development was hurried to meet a publication deadline. 
								Glitches can range from minor graphical errors to serious bugs that can delete saved data or cause the game to 
								malfunction.
